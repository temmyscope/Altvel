## About AltVel

=> AltVel is developed by Elisha Temiloluwa a.k.a TemmyScope	

=> Inspired By Phalcon & Laravel Php Web Application Frameworks.

AltVel is a web application framework with priority on security, performance and standard-compliance. 
We believe development must be an enjoyable, flexible and creative experience to be truly fulfilling; 
hence we take the "boring stuffs" out of web appliction development for php developers (code Engineers). 

AltVel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

# [ Simple, efficient & fast routing engine ]

# ModelTrait for database data retrieval built on Doctrine's dbal package

# Supports all PHP PDO supported database types 

# Improved Model class for eloquent data retrieval[method chaining]

# Engineer Console:

	=> Build Controllers, Model & Views from Console [ To see all commands: php Engineer]
	
	=> Automatically generate keys for secured session, cookie and salt

# A Utility HTML Builder [Fast Development for Backend Php developers]


The following conventions are used:

# All view files must reside in a folder within the view folder within the public folder with respect to the view they display. 

#	The only file exempted is the app.blade.php which is the default view file for rendering.

#	All classes that extend the Model class, should be placed directly under the app folder.

AltVel is accessible, flexible, editable, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning AltVel

AltVel has no syntax of its own but uses the inherited php syntax, making it extremely easy for an average php developer to make use of.

## AltVel How-To

# The HTML template builder library is used to ease off frontend development but does not eliminate the need for a frontend designer:

	=> Several helper methods are available for use.
	
	=> Generates csrf token for each page to improve security against cross-site request forgery
	
	=> Together with the user_navbar array in Config.php, NavBar with dropdowns can be automatically generated
	
	=> Generates CSRF-secured Form using  Array construct passed to generateForm static method

# In order to access data sent to the View renderer, use $dataSource variable; 



# Please Note that this framework is not suitable as an Api framework. Use the SevenPHP Microservice Framework for optimal performance



## Creating Migrations

# This section shows you how to :- 
	*create database,
	*migrate, 
	*populate, 
	*drop 
	table(s) using the name



# Database Creation
Database can be created using the terminal, for example, to create a database called music, use:
```bash
	php Engineer app::db music
```

Migrations can be added to the App\Providers\MigrationEngine migrate method in the form:

```php

###
return [
	//table ids are automatically generated as primary keys
	'apps' => [
		//the referenced table must already exist and the name must be exact to avoid errors
		'token' => $this->foreign_key($table='sessions_table', $column='session' $type = 'int' || 'string'),

		//$key can be one of [ 'primary', 'unique','fulltext', '' ]
		'name' => $this->string($max_length=125, $null=true),

		'pos' => $this->integer($max_length=10),

		//in other to specify a maximum length, float should be used instead of a double
		'account_balance' => $this->double() || $this->float($max_length=16), 
		
		'is_verified' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" ),
		
		'created_at' => $this->datetime()
	],
	//constraints: a table can only have one primary key and it will be autogenerated
	'users' => [
		'name' => $this->string($max_length=125, $null=false),
		'email' => $this->string($max_length=125, $null=false, $key='unique'),
		'password' => $this->string($max_length=125),
		'backup_pass' => $this->string($max_length=150),
		'activation' => $this->string($max_length=225),
		'verified' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" ),
		'created_at' => $this->datetime(),
		'deleted' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" )
	],
	
	'user_sessions' => [
		'user_id' => $this->foreign_key($table='users', $column='id', $type = 'int' ),
		'session' => $this->string($max_length=225, $null=false),
		'user_agent' => $this->string($max_length=225, $null=false),
		'push_token' => $this->string($max_length=225, $null=false),
		'created_at' => $this->datetime(),
		'deleted' => $this->oneOf($options=["'true'", "'false'"], $default="'false'" )
	],
];
//constraints: a table can only have one primary key and it will be autogenerated
### id is auto-generated and would be ignored
``` 

Populating a table with data can be done by adding array of arrays to the App\Providers\MigrationEngine populate method's return array
```php
###

return [
	'table name' => [ 'column name' => 'value' , 'column name' => 'value' , 'column name' => 'value' ],
	'table name' => [...],
];

#always remove the arrays after migration
###

```

Dropping table(s) can be done by adding table names to the App\Providers\MigrationEngine drop method's return array
```php

return [ 'user', 'user_sessions' ]; //drop tables

```

# Migration Generation Steps

=> After creating migrations

=> Add Name of tables to be migrated to the MIGRATION array in the configuration app.php file in the config folder

```php
'MIGRATION' => [
	'users', 'user_session', 'contact_us'
]
#Always remember to remove already migrated models from the array
```

=>then run "php Engineer app::migrate" in the terminal
