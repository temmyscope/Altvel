### About AltVel/SevenPHP

	- AltVel is developed by Elisha Temiloluwa a.k.a TemmyScope	

	- Inspired By Phalcon & Laravel Php Web Application Frameworks.

***AltVel is a web application framework with priority on security, performance and standard-compliance (Im that order). 
We believe development must be enjoyable, flexible and creative; hence we take the "routines" out of web application development for php developers (code Engineers). 
***

	- Install using composer
```
composer require altvel/altvel
```

	=> Recommended: Create Project automatically using composer
```
coomposer create-project altvel/altvel
```

	- You can also download through github; This would involve a lot of manual configuration  


### AltVel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:
##

***Simple, efficient & fast routing Engines***

***ModelTrait for database data retrieval built on Doctrine's dbal package***

***Supports all PHP PDO supported database types***

***Improved Model class for eloquent data retrieval[method chaining]***

***Engineer Console: [ To see all commands: php Engineer]***
	
***Automatically generate keys for secured session, cookie and salt***

***A Utility HTML Template Builder [Fast Development for Backend Php developers]***


### The following conventions are used:
##

	=> All view files must reside in a folder within the view folder within the public folder with respect to the view they display.
	
***Generate using the commandline:***

***To generate a home view folder and initialize an index blade file...***
```bash
 php Engineer app::view home
```
***To generate a specific file in an existing view folder: 
	For example creating edit blade file in profile folder***

```bash
 php Engineer app::view profile edit
```

	=> The only file exempted is the app.blade.php which is the default view file for rendering.

	=> All classes that extend the Model class, should be placed directly under the app folder.


AltVel is accessible, flexible, editable, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning AltVel

AltVel has no syntax of its own but uses the inherited php syntax, making it extremely easy for an average php developer to make use of.

## AltVel How-To

##### The HTML template builder Helper class does not eliminate the need for a frontend designer:
####

	=> Several helper methods are available for use.
	
	=> Generates csrf token for each page to improve security against cross-site request forgery
	
	=> Together with the user_navbar array in Config.php, NavBar with dropdowns can be automatically generated
	
	=> Generates CSRF-secured Form using  Array construct passed to generateForm static method

### In order to access data sent to the View renderer, use $dataSource variable;

### Todos
##
***Readme.md, Console helper, unit testing and intrinsic application configurations,
such as logging, other helpers, structuring  are still being improved.***


### Development & Library Integration
##
***integrations are done to fit a minimal, lightweight and performant production version.
Hence libraries that are not required for production are not added to the framework using composer,
rather they are built into the Application, so they are only autoloaded when called.
A loose and less-overwhelming feel is kept on the number of folders and files.
Due  to the PHP-8 feature for preloading, any simple library not necessary for development
would not be added/required to reduce the memory effect of preloading autoloaded files.***
